pucker
======

This is my final graduation project for the Computer Engeneer bac. degree at PUC-Rio university.

To play around in IRB, you must change to `lib/` directory and call `irb`:
```
cd lib/
irb
  > require 'pucker'
  > g = Pucker::Game.new
  > g.play
```

To execute tests, you must be in root directory, install bundler and rspec:
```
cd /[PROGRAMMING_FOLDER]/pucker/
gem install bundler
bundle install
```
And you must execute rspec:
```
rspec --format doc # to view tests output as documentation
rspec # to simply run the tests without generating documentation
```

Current documentation generated by tests:
```
Pucker::Player
