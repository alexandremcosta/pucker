pucker
======

#### Pucker is a No Limit Texas Hold'em emulator, together with a collection of four different players, that can be used to play against each other.

## Specification
- Simulate Texas Hold'em poker rounds
- Generate statistics about the round winners and losers
- Given the end of a poker round, evaluate who are the winners, and reward the prizes
- Players should calculate an amount to bet, given a poker scenario

## General class description
*Game* is the most important class. It manages the game rounds, collecting bets, dealing cards from the
dealer to the players, evaluating winners and distributing rewards.

*Dealer* distributes *Cards*. *Players* receive *Cards*, and based on current state (position, previous bets...)
it should calculate how much to bet. Calculating the bet is the optimization goal: it should maximize rewards
on the long run.

To implement a new betting strategy, you should extend the *Player* class. There are some implemented examples:
- Player: always check
- DummyPlayer: bet randomly
- SimpleBnPlayer: uses a bayesian network to evaluate minimum bet and hand strength
- BnPlayer: similar to SimpleBnPlayer, but combines minimum bet with table strengh in a single bayesian variable
- BestBnPlayer: similar to GoodBnPlayer, but uses position instead of table rank

In addition, the framework has a logging class and a statistics class to track progress.

A full report of the whole project can be found on doc/final_report.pdf.

## Running

You must install JRuby, bundler (package manager) and project dependencies.

1) To install JRuby, you must first install Java (from your package manager).

2) Install RVM (ruby version manager) and finally JRuby:
```
$ gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
$ rvm install jruby
```

2) Instal bundler and project dependencies:
```
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

To play around in IRB (interactive Ruby shell):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/alexandremcosta/pucker.git
$ cd pucker
$ irb
  > require './lib/pucker'
  > g = Pucker::Game.new
  > g.play
```

## Running automated tests

The project currently has around 90% of code coverage from automated tests.  
A Test-Driven Development approach was applied since the beginning of development.  
Tests are capable of generating documentation.

To run the tests:
```
$ rspec --format doc # to view tests output as documentation
$ rspec # to simply run the tests without generating documentation
```

Current documentation generated by tests:
